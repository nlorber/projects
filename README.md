# Data Science / Machine Learning Projects

These are some of the projects I worked on while following the Data Scientist program at [**OpenClassrooms**](https://openclassrooms.com/en/paths/164-data-scientist) / [**CentraleSup√©lec**](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en).  
They touch upon diverse ML models (regression/classification/clustering, supervised/unsupervised, deep learning, etc.) in a wide varity of fields (banking, retail, energy, agronomy), as well as DevOps skills (API, cloud infrastructure, etc.).  
Each folder will contain a dedicated README file, going into greater details regarding the specifics of the project such as the mission, the origin and characteristics of the dataset, and important steps and results of the process. But below are already short summaries of the topics, skills and most significant libraries involved for each project.
